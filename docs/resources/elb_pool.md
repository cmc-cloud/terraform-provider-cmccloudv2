# cmccloudv2_elb_pool (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# create simple ELB pool
resource "cmccloudv2_elb_pool" "pool_1"{
    elb_id 				= "40b37c15-3888-4bf4-8fb5-396d2363beac"
    name 				= "pool_1"
    description 		= "my pool 1" 
    protocol 			= "HTTP"
    algorithm 			= "ROUND_ROBIN"
    session_persistence = "NONE"
}

# create simple ELB pool with session_persistence is APP_COOKIE
resource "cmccloudv2_elb_pool" "pool_2"{
    elb_id 				= "40b37c15-3888-4bf4-8fb5-396d2363beac"
    name				= "pool_2"
    description 		= "my pool 2" 
    protocol 			= "HTTP"
    algorithm 			= "ROUND_ROBIN"
    session_persistence = "APP_COOKIE"
    cookie_name 		= "your_cookie_name" 
}

# create simple ELB pool with tls support
resource "cmccloudv2_elb_pool" "pool_3"{
    elb_id 				= "40b37c15-3888-4bf4-8fb5-396d2363beac"
    name				= "pool_3"
    description 		= "my pool 3" 
    protocol 			= "HTTP"
    algorithm 			= "ROUND_ROBIN"
    session_persistence = "NONE"
    tls_enabled 		= true

## Schema

### Required

- `algorithm` (String) The algorithm used to distribute traffic to the pool members. A valid value is ROUND_ROBIN, LEAST_CONNECTIONS, SOURCE_IP, or SOURCE_IP_PORT.
- `elb_id` (String) The ID of the ELB to attach the pool to
- `name` (String) The name of the pool
- `protocol` (String) The protocol for which this pool and its members listen. A valid value is HTTP, HTTPS, PROXY, PROXYV2, SCTP, TCP, or UDP.

### Optional

- `cookie_name` (String) The name of the cookie to use for session persistence. Only applicable to the APP_COOKIE session persistence type where it is required.
- `description` (String) A description of the pool. Changing this updates the pool's description.
- `session_persistence` (String) Session persistence type for the pool. One of NONE, APP_COOKIE, HTTP_COOKIE, or SOURCE_IP.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `tls_ciphers` (String) List of ciphers in OpenSSL format (colon-separated)
- `tls_enabled` (Boolean) When true connections to backend member servers will use TLS encryption. Default is false.
- `tls_versions` (List of String) A list of TLS protocol versions. Available versions: SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The creation time of the pool
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `listener_id` (String) The ID of the listener that the pool attached to
- `operating_status` (String) Shows the real runtime health of the pool.
- `provisioning_status` (String) The state of the operation — in other words, whether pool is still creating, updating, or deleting the resource.
